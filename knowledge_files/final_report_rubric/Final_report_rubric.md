Tiny Earth Genomics **Report Rubric** In an academic research setting, scientists write up their results to be submitted to journals, and before they are published they are subjected to *peer review*, where other scientists evaluate the manuscript and determine whether the authors' conclusions are valid based on the presented evidence. In industrial or other research settings, scientists still generally write up their results, but perhaps for their supervisors or regulatory agencies. Therefore, it is an important skill to write scientific papers.

You will be writing an *individual* research report - the primary reason for this is so that I can assess your understanding of the research as a whole. But, you will include all the results from your group. This will necessitate sharing of data and figures, and perhaps most of the methods.

While you will probably have to share figures and methods text, I would like you to write the other parts of the report (Introduction, Results, *Discussion/Conclusions)* in your *own words (i.e. do not plagiarize your colleagues).* Some general notes:
- Write your report in full *sentences*, especially to demonstrate reasoning and understanding.

- Assume the reader knows nothing about the subject of metagenomics, and make sure to explain concepts - this is mainly so that I can determine if you understand these concepts. If your understanding is not apparent from the words you *have* written, I can't assume what is *in your mind.*
- The report should be a cohesive piece of writing that could be read all together, with paragraphs following on logically. Don't make it look like a list of separate items cobbled together to satisfy the rubric.

- Type your report (I will not accept hand-written assignments) and submit through Canvas. Make sure your report is neatly and logically laid out. Include your name on the report itself so they don't get mixed on my end.

Your report should contain the following items, scored according to the points shown below.

Note: You don't have to write the report in strict order of the sections below. I would recommend the following as a good order to do things:
1. Collect figures from your group and write captions. 2. As a group work on the methods section, and make sure everything is there. 3. Write the results 4. Write the discussions/conclusion 5. Write the title and introduction 6. Write the abstract when you know how the rest of the report looks like.

## Title (5 Points)

- This can be the same as the poster, but the point is that it should be descriptive and give an idea of what was done and maybe also the conclusion. It should not be very long.

## Abstract (5 Points)

- The abstract can be up to ~250 words and is used to briefly summarize the motivations of the study, what was done and what the conclusions were.

- Generally, you don't include citations in the abstract, but if there are citations that you would have included, make sure they are cited in the introduction.

## Introduction (25 Points)

- At the beginning of the introduction there should be a summary of what is known about the system you are studying, with citations. This includes what was previously done in the paper you got the data from.

- You should write a brief explanation of genome-resolved metagenomics and determine by looking in the literature whether there are many genome-resolved studies in the same field as your study (for example, high metal exposure environments).

- You should describe in the introductions what motivated you to study this system
(perhaps this could include pointing out what is not yet known about it), and what your hypothesis/ hypotheses was/were going into the project. If applicable, you should outline what makes your study different/new from existing work.

- You should summarize what was done in your study, and what were the main conclusions.

## Results (25 Points)

The results section outlines the investigations that were done and their immediate outcomes. You can think of it as sort of an intermediate between the methods section and the discussion section. In the Results, you don't need to get bogged down with all the details of how everything was done (that is what the methods are for), and you don't need to think about the broader implications of the results you are seeing - that is what the Discussion section is for. A quick example - say we did a study that involved amplifying a type of gene from a bacterium. The methods would include a detailed description of the primer sequence, how it was designed, the temperature settings and other details of the PCR program, what thermocycler was used, etc. The results section would state something like "We were able to amplify gene X from the bacterium's genomic DNA". The discussion would comment on whether the finding that the bacterium had gene X is unusual compared to its relatives and whether this finding is unusual amongst other bacteria studied. The easiest way to write a results section is as follows:
- Decide upon a logical order for your figures and tables - this could be the same as in your poster but you may be able to include more figures/tables in your report compared to your poster. Generally the order is decided in such a way as to best tell the story of your investigations, in other words you put analyses that are foundational at the beginning and put others that rely on the outcomes of earlier steps later.

- For each figure and table in turn, write why the analysis was carried out (or what question was asked), a description of the analysis that was done, and the conclusions that could be reached from that analysis. If you find it useful, you could imagine how you would explain each figure/table to someone orally.
Discussion/conclusion (25 points) The Discussion section is used to put your results in context with other work reported in the literature. What that means is that in the Discussion you will go beyond the immediate results and conclusions (that were discussed in the Results), and you may need to look up papers in the literature and cite them. When you cite papers, make sure to explain their relevance to your study and the conclusions that can be made through comparing your results to theirs (if applicable). That way, I can assess whether the inclusion of the citation is relevant and appropriate, and that you understood the relevant details of the cited paper. Discussion sections are also used to speculate on what your results might mean, and the mechanisms that might be causing the observed phenomena. For example, if you found an unusual nitrogen-fixing gene in a bacterium, you might suggest in the Discussion that the gene evolved due to a lack of amino acid availability in the surrounding environment. A good approach to writing a Discussion is to go through your results and address whether other literature results are relevant and if there are logical explanations for your results. Note: The mechanisms suggested in Discussions do not have to be proven by your studies (otherwise they would appear in the Results), but they could be fruitful avenues for further study. Discussion sections typically have a concluding paragraph that goes into what the study concluded, and its limitations. This part of the Discussion is often used to suggest further studies that build upon the current manuscript.

## Methods (10 Points)

The methods section is supposed to contain enough detail that someone reading your paper would be able to repeat your analysis with the same data. So, you should arrange this section in such a way that this task would be easy for someone in that position.

Note: Methods are different from results - they just focus on how everything was done, and you don't typically mention outcomes or conclusions in the methods section.

- You should make a subheading for each different procedure
- Each procedure should be described in the past tense and using passive voice (i.e.

"x was done", not "I did x" or "do x").
In each subsection, think about what would be needed to repeat the procedure. In each case your text should be able to answer the following questions:
1. What software tool(s) were used? Give the name and provide a citation for where to download or the paper describing it.

2. What platform was used? Describe how it was run - on your computer, CyVerse or Kbase, etc.

3. What parameters and databases were used? Make sure to note the options that were used during a run and in things like diamond searches, what was the query and what was the database.

4. How was the data processed after the analysis? For example, was a table made in Excel, and was a visualization made in R? For the latter, you should ideally give details of modules used and options used in plotting.

References (5 points) I don't think you need to include a large number of references - I would rather that you fully understand the ones you include. They should be relevant and the citation should be accurate.
