Tiny Earth Genomics **Poster Rubric** Posters are used to present new scientific results at meetings and conferences. Typically, there will be a big room where posters are displayed, and one of the authors will stand by the poster to talk to interested parties about the project, while pointing out specific figures on the poster. As a group, you will make a poster to show the results of your project, and in class you will orally present the poster. Because each team-member is expected to contribute at least one figure, you will be expected to present your part of the poster. The poster assignment will count for 20% of your overall grade, as follows. (**75 points**)

## General Notes

- Posters are generally 4 feet (48 inches) across and 3 feet (36 inches) tall, so text on your poster should be readable when printed out to that size.

- Some posters use a lot more text than others, and to some extent this is an authorial choice. However, your understanding of the project will mainly be graded in the presentation, and therefore you may use more space for figures in your poster.

- You may wish to submit your poster to the Tiny Earth Symposium (Link to be posted in Canvas). This is a super fun event that will be in-person this year. Presentations will be 5 minutes only, and so that portion will have to be shortened compared to your presentation in class.

## Graded As A Group - Poster Design And Scientific Rigor

As a group, you are all responsible for the design and organization of the poster, in particular that it is presented in a logical manner, and that the scientific conclusions are adequately justified by evidence presented on the poster. Required items (10 **points**) You are free to choose exactly how to organize your poster, but it should have the following items:

1. A title describing your project and its main conclusions (**1 point**) 2. A list of authors (i.e. group members) - probably best to list in alphabetical order of last name (**1 points**)
3. Abstract - a short summary of background to the project, what studies you did and why (including your hypotheses), and the overall conclusions (**5 points**)
4. Author contributions - towards the end of the document, list the specific contributions of each author to the work. You can use initials to save space, as long as it is obvious who did what (**2 points**)
5. References - a list of references cited anywhere in your poster. Include enough information for the source to be located for a reader - for a journal article this would include the journal name, year of publication, volume and page numbers of the article (**1 point**)
Note: Because you are using previously published data, it would make sense to cite the original paper and state how your study differs from what was previously done.

Clarity and design (20 **points**) You will be able to explain your poster orally during the presentation, but ideally someone passing your poster when you are not around should be able to get the gist of what you did. You will therefore get points for the following features:

- Figures are organized under logical and descriptive section headings (5 **points**)
- Figures include explanation of color scales and axes, such that interpretation by the reader is possible (**5 points**)
- Key findings are written clearly (**5 points**)
- Space is used efficiently (i.e. not a lot of whitespace) but not too jam packed.

Figure text should be readable at the printed size (**5 points**)
Scientific rigor and integrity (20 **points**) It is important for your poster to accurately reflect both the science presented and literature citations. It is advisable prior to submitting the poster and doing the presentation that you double check anything you are not sure about with your team mates and instructors.

- The findings of cited literature is accurately represented in the poster, cited papers are relevant and appropriate to the study (**5 points**)
- The abstract accurately represents what was done and what is presented in the poster (**5 points**)
- Headings accurately reflect what is presented underneath (**5 points**)
- The logic connecting presented figures and key findings is clear (**5 points**)

## Graded Individually - Oral Presentation (25 Points)

Your group will do an oral presentation in class, using the poster as the only visual, and each person will present their own contribution in ~5 mins. After the presentation there will be questions to answer about your work. It would probably be a good idea to have the first person do a short introduction before they talk about their part, and the last person could also do a wrap up and mention overall conclusions that were drawn. Because of the low resolution of the projector in the classroom, you may zoom into your part of the poster when you talk about it. Note: Although graded individually, it is in your interest to make the talk as a whole cohesive and flow logically. During your presentation you will need to demonstrate:
- That you understand why you did the analysis you are describing, and the questions you aimed to answer (**5 points**)
- That that you understand the analysis you carried out (**5 points**)
- That you understand the limitations of your analysis, in particular what it does and does not allow you to conclude (**5 points**)
- That your conclusion is logical based on your analyses (**5 points**)
- That you can suggest what other studies are the logical next step and/or would shed more light on the situation based on your conclusions (5 points).
