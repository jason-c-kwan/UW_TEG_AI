Credits: 3 credits [4 contact hours, ~6 hours out-of-class work per **week]** Course **Description:** Collaborate on a research project from the conception of research questions, through data analysis and the effective communication of results. Explore the biosynthesis of antibiotics and other small molecules by uncultured bacteria through the analysis of culture-independent DNA sequencing (metagenomics) data, learning about bioinformatics and genomics along the way. You may make new discoveries of microbial species, biochemical pathways and more! Enrollment is through consent of instructor. Prerequisites: BIOLOGY/ZOOLOGY 101, BOTANY/BIOLOGY/ZOOLOGY 151, MICROBIO 101, 303, or BIOCORE 381 Enrollment Requirements: Consent of **instructor.** Meeting Time and Location: Two 120-minute classes per week, 3255 College Library WisCEL center, 12:15 PM - 2:15 PM **Tue/Thur.** Instructional **Modality** In-person. How Credit Hours are met by the **Course** According to UW-Madison policy, we define a credit hour as 45 hours of learning activities, including in-class and out-of-class student work. This course has two 120-minute class periods per week, and so you should expect to put in approximately 6 hours of work toward the course per week (total 140 hours over 14 weeks). Regular and substantive student-instructor **interaction** Instructors will guide students through learning activities during each class session, and will also facilitate student-led research in class. Instructors will provide feedback on assignments and presentations, as well as being available to field questions outside of class time.

## Course Website, Learning Management System And Instructional Tools

Main course website: **https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/397968** In addition, students can join the class Slack *workspace* at https://tinyearthgeno-7ld8498.slack.com, where they can conduct real-time *discussions* with their team and the **instructors.** We will be using Benchling for lab notebooks **(https://benchling.com/academic** to register). We will be using Cyverse in order to do data analysis in the cloud *(https://cyverse.org).*

## Class Sessions

Students should bring their laptops to all class sessions, OR take detailed notes of **their** analyses carried out on desktop computers in class such that they can access their work **online** after the class (we will use Benchling as an online lab notebook). Attendance and **participation** in the course is essential. If you absolutely must miss class, please contact the *course* coordinator as far in advance as possible. Please follow UW's guidelines upon known **exposure** to COVID-19 or testing *positive* (https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/medical/covid19-isolation-quarantine/).

## Recommended Textbooks & Other Course Materials

We have written a Handbook to accompany this course - this will be distributed in class and on Canvas. It is recommended that you have access to a computer to carry out analyses outside of class, and a computer may also be useful in communicating with your team (see https://it.wisc.edu/learn/guides/computers-equipment-students-what-do-i-need/). The base UW hardware recommendations will be sufficient as we will be doing all computation through online and cloud resources. All software used for data analysis in this course will be free and opensource where possible, with the exception that access to Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint) would be useful when you produce written reports, presentations and posters. However, free alternatives to these are available, for example Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides or on MacOS: Pages, Sheets and Keynote.

## Lecture Handouts:

These will be available on the Canvas course site (http://canvas.wisc.edu) and will consist of the documents presented during lectures. Handouts and other supplementary materials may also be sent by email as pdf files. Please make sure your official email address is functioning as we will use the classlist mechanism for sending materials and other information via email.

## Exams, Quizzes, Papers & Other Major Graded Work

There will be no exams for this course, but your final grade is based partly on the following items of coursework:
- A poster and accompanying oral presentation that you will make with your research team. You will be responsible for at least one figure used in the poster and the part of the oral presentation that explains that figure. (20%)
- A written research report covering your team's project, that you write as an individual.

(30%)

## Homework & Other Assignments

Homework assignments are mainly to aid in your understanding of the material, and to help you prepare your research poster and report. Accordingly, you may find that you can use a lot of the assignments in your report/poster, with some adaptation. Feedback will be given on homework assignments as much as possible. Assignments for a week are typically due on 9:00 AM the following Monday after they are released.

## How To Succeed In This Course

This course will rely heavily on active learning and teamwork to complete a research project over the semester. Although the final research report and group poster count for 50% of your grade, the other half will be dependent upon attendance and participation in the classes, as well as working with your team. Therefore, the best way to ensure your success is to regularly attend class and contribute to your team's research project. Another aspect of grading is the completion of homework assignments. These are doubly useful to you as they are designed to help with specific aspects of your final reports and posters. Likewise, readings will give you context and background to each module's subject, which will make it easier to hit the ground running with your project. I would also advise you to take full advantage of the poster and report rubrics, as well as scientific papers discussed during the class. Lastly, we have tried to assume only a small amount of background knowledge, but we are likely to overlook some things here and there. If there is anything you don't understand or would like to talk about in more detail, please do not hesitate to contact us for clarification. For some aspects of your project, you may find it useful to speak to other members of your research team. For this sort of interaction you may consider arranging to meet up outside of class.

| UNIT 2 Objectives: Identify work that has already been done on datasets of interest, formulate hypotheses based on what is already known, and begin scientific investigation 6 Feb 27– Feb 29 Read through the following sections in the handbook: - Tiny Earth Genomics report rubric [pages 119-122, ~6 min read] - Tiny Earth Genomics poster rubric [pages 123-125, ~4 min read] In groups of 2, pick a dataset, and analyze the paper together Submit your research question and write a paragraph of background research. Note: This will form the bulk of your report introduction and provide key points for your poster. Pick a dataset and devise hypotheses Decide upon some hypotheses and what you aim to investigate/prove Decide what analyses are required to test your hypotheses based on what you know about metagenomics methods Submit your hypotheses, experimental aims, proposed analyses and a rationale of why you picked those analyses.

| UNIT 3 Objectives: Finish research project, produce a research report and poster presentation 11 Apr 9–Apr 11 As a group, collate all plots you have made, and write one sentence for each explaining the inferences they allow you to make about your data. Make a list of inferences you can make based on the figures and other analyses you have done, and try to arrange them into a logical "story" that will be followed in your report/poster. Note: This will form an outline of the report you will write. | Write notes in your Benchling notebook, describing your activities this week [graded]                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                |                                                                                         |
